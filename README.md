# PAJOT Basile

Having done a double diploma in an agronomy engineering school (L'institut Agro Montpellier) and a master orinted towards Biodiversity, Ecology and Evolution (at the University of Montpellier), I am currently a second year PhD student at the Statin Biologique de Roscoff, where I did my master's thesis.

I am interested by speciation questions and more particularly the following questions:

How do barriers to reproduction appear and become associated to form different species?

How do isolation between closely-related species evolve?

How do phenotypic traits involved in barriers to reproduction evolve?

What is the role played by chromosomal rearrangements in the speciation process?

How is the speciation process translated at the genome scale?

From January to July 2024, I did a comparative genomic study of Littorina fabalis. This marine gastropod is found on the ficoid belt along the shore and forms hybrid zones between ecotypes that are locally adapted to wave exposure gradients (see Johannesson et al., 2025 or Le Moan et al., 2016 for definitions of ecotype). In addition, these ecotypes are differentiated by chromosomal inversions that play a role in local adaptation. We thus compared a hybrid zone in Sweden and a hybrid zone in France using whole genome data.
